# Hackatime Zed

This is a fork of the official hackatime extension made to work with Hackatime! It sends more data to be spec compliant :p
I don't know if this will work better but ....

## woa

this was just a test to see if the plugin worked but eh i'm probably going to forgot and push this \o/

## this doesn't work

ugh this is strange oes it feel like a normal keyboard why does it feel sticky compared to a real one
